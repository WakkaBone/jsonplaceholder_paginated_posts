## PAGINATED POSTS FROM JSONPLACEHOLDER

Posts are being fetched from the jsonplaceholder api, six at a time. Each page contains six posts. Switching to other pages triggers fetching of new posts.

The "Add post" button sends the request to the fake server, so don't expect a new post to be created.

App is written on **React** with **Redux** used for state management. **Styled-Components** is used for styling.

Run **npm start** to launch the app.
