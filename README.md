## PAGINATED POSTS FROM JSONPLACEHOLDER

Posts are being fetched from the jsonplaceholder api, six at a time. Each page contains six posts. You can change the number of posts being fetched and displayed per page simply by changing the value of the postsPerPage variable in the App component. Switching to other pages triggers fetching of new posts.

The "Add post" button sends the request to the fake server, so don't expect a new post to be created.

App is written on **React** with **Redux** used for state management. **Styled-Components** is used for styling.

Run **npm start** to launch the app.
